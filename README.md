# Face recognition deep_learn_project

1)First step collect data with : face_capture.py

2)Second step. preprocees all the data in order to have the same format using : random _face_preprocess.py

3)Third step perform augmented photos by using : augmentation_techniques_photos.py

4)Create a folder for all the photos and within the folder create subfolders . each folder has to have a name which will be the label for the face and a folder with unknown faces

5)Train the model using train_to_photos_ver4_pretrained.py to use the resnet50 pretrained model or the train_to_photos_custom_multy.py to use out custom made CNN .

6) dont forget to adjust the folder location within each .py file to correspond to your files.
